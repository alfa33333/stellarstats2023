This year's Stellar Stats workshop aims to continue strengthening connections between the Statistics and Astronomy communities at U of T with a focus on research questions, types of data and data challenges, and methodologies. Our organizing theme this year is "Inference under Pressure", with a focus on solving inference challenges that are shared across statistics and astronomy (e.g., censorship, small sample sizes, sampling bias, MCMC, etc.).
